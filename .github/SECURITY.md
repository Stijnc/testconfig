- Impact of the issue, including how one might exploit the issue

## Preferred languages

We prefer all communication in English, Dutch or French

## security ratings

Every vulnerability is rated with one of the following security levels:

- critical
- high
- moderate
- low

### Critical security issues

Any critical security issue requires an immediate fix. An issue is critical if it is technically a high security issues that is known to be currently exploited or would put a high number of users at severe risk if being exploited

### High security issues

An issue is marked as high if it is exploitable and would lead to compromise of user data.

### Moderate security issues

These issues are generally not as severe as high security issues because they require user interaction or require other additional circumstances/vulnerabilities to be exploitable.

### Low security issues

These issues have security implications but donâ€™t have any (known) exploit path or the exploit requires excessive resources, or is very limited in scope, or leaks insensitive information.
